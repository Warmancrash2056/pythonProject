#List Function#

# List is a built-in system that can hold multiple values. 
#there are 4 types of list function in python.

# List are the most basic type of list function that can be changed in any which way.
#they can be reordered, # duplicated and change the values once created.

# Example #

names = ['Davaughn', 'Jake', 'Kim']
print(names)
# Output ['Davaughn', 'Jake', 'Kim']

# How to acess items in list function #

# List items can be acessed through indexing both negative and positive. also by checking items exist in the list.
# Positive Indexing and Negative Indexing
print(names[0]) # Output Davaughn
print(names[1]) # Output Jake
print(names[-1]) # Output Kim as the name is the last in the list

# Indexing mutliple elements
# When multi Indexing rememeber that the last number in postive (3) will not be output and aswell the negative index (-3)
names = ['jason', 'mat' , 'john', 'china']
print(names[1:3])
print(names[-3:-1])

# List can be used to store multiple data types both even in the same list function
# Example #
multi_data_types = ['happy', 40 , 0.5, False]
print(multi_data_types)
